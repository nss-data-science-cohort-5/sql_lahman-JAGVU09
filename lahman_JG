1. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. 
Create a list showing each player's first and last names as well as the 
total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending 
order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money
in the majors?

label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B",

Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

3. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920.
Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game.
Do you see any trends? (Hint: For this question, you might find it helpful to look at
the **generate_series** function (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-srf.html).

the world series? What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world

series champion; determine why this is the case. Then redo your query, excluding the
